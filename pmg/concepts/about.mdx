# About PMG

[SafeDep PMG](https://github.com/safedep/pmg) is a free and open source Package Manager Guard that protects developers from malicious packages by wrapping your favorite package managers and blocking dangerous packages at install time.

## Architecture Overview

PMG operates through two primary installation workflows, each with distinct dependency resolution strategies:

### Workflow 1: Direct Package Installation

When users install individual packages directly:

```bash
npm install express
pip install requests
pnpm add lodash
```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Command Interception**: PMG intercepts the package manager command
2. **Dependency Resolution**: PMG resolves all transitive dependencies for the requested package
3. **Threat Analysis**: All packages in the dependency tree are analyzed for malware
4. **Installation Decision**: Clean packages proceed to installation, malicious packages are blocked

### Workflow 2: Manifest File Installation

When users install from manifest files:

```bash
npm install          # Uses package-lock.json/pnpm-lock.yaml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Process Flow for npm/pnpm:**
- **Lockfile Analysis**: Dependencies are already resolved in lockfiles (package-lock.json, pnpm-lock.yaml)
- **Direct Analysis**: PMG analyzes the pre-resolved dependency list
- **No Resolution Needed**: Skip dependency resolution step

**Process Flow for pip (requirements.txt):**
- **Manual Resolution**: Dependencies are NOT pre-resolved in requirements.txt
- **Dependency Resolution**: PMG must resolve transitive dependencies for each package
- **Full Analysis**: Analyze all resolved packages in the dependency tree

**SafeDep PMG** intelligently adapts its analysis strategy based on the installation method, ensuring comprehensive security coverage while optimizing performance for different ecosystem patterns.

## Core Technical Components

### 1. Command Interception Layer

PMG creates intelligent aliases for supported package managers:

```bash
# After pmg setup, these commands are automatically protected:
npm install express        # ✅ Clean package - installs normally
npm install malicious-pkg  # 🚫 Blocked - malicious package detected
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Shell alias creation for transparent command wrapping
- Cross-shell compatibility (bash, zsh, fish)
- Argument parsing and forwarding to maintain compatibility

### 2. Dependency Resolution Engine

PMG employs different dependency resolution strategies based on the installation method:

#### Strategy 1: Direct Package Installation Resolution

For direct package installations (`npm install express`, `pip install requests`):

```
Your Package Request: express@^4.18.0
├── PMG Resolves Transitive Dependencies
│   ├── accepts@~1.3.8 (✅ Clean)
│   ├── array-flatten@1.1.1 (✅ Clean)
│   ├── body-parser@1.20.1 (✅ Clean)
│   │   ├── bytes@3.1.2 (✅ Clean)
│   │   ├── content-type@~1.0.4 (✅ Clean)
│   │   └── debug@2.6.9 (🚫 Malicious - BLOCKED!)
│   └── cookie-signature@1.0.6 (✅ Clean)
└── All packages analyzed before installation
```

**Resolution Process:**
- PMG queries package registries to build complete dependency tree
- Applies semantic versioning rules to resolve version ranges
- Considers peer dependencies and optional dependencies
- Builds complete manifest of all packages that would be installed

#### Strategy 2: Manifest File Resolution

**npm/pnpm Ecosystem (Pre-resolved Dependencies):**
```bash
npm install  # Uses package-lock.json
```

- **Lockfile Parsing**: Dependencies already resolved with exact versions
- **Direct Analysis**: PMG reads resolved dependency list from lockfiles
- **No Version Resolution**: Skip dependency resolution since versions are locked
- **Efficient Processing**: Faster analysis due to pre-resolved state

**Python Ecosystem (Requirements Resolution):**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Manual Resolution Required**: requirements.txt contains only direct dependencies
- **Transitive Resolution**: PMG must resolve all transitive dependencies
- **Version Constraint Handling**: Processes version specifiers (>=, ==, ~=, etc.)
- **Complete Tree Building**: Builds full dependency tree similar to direct installs

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Lockfile Format Support:**
- `package-lock.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm)
- Future: `yarn.lock` support planned

**Requirements Processing:**
```python
# requirements.txt example
requests>=2.25.0,<3.0.0
django==4.2.7
# -e git+https://github.com/user/repo.git  # Git URLs skipped
flask[async]  # Extra dependencies resolved
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Approximate Version Resolution**: Intelligently resolves version ranges (e.g., `^1.2.0`)
- **Semver Compatibility**: Understands semantic versioning rules
- **Peer Dependency Analysis**: Considers peer dependency requirements
- **Lock File Interpretation**: Respects existing lock file constraints

### 3. Threat Detection System

PMG employs multiple detection mechanisms:

#### Malicious Package Database
- Continuously updated database of known malicious packages
- Real-time scanning of new packages as they're published
- Community-driven threat intelligence sharing

#### Behavioral Analysis
- Static analysis of package contents
- Detection of suspicious code patterns
- Identification of obfuscated malicious code

#### Name-based Detection
- Typosquatting pattern recognition
- Dependency confusion attack detection
- Suspicious naming convention analysis

## Supported Ecosystems & Limitations

### Currently Supported

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Node.js Ecosystem" icon="node-js">
    **npm** and **pnpm** - Full protection for JavaScript packages from npmjs.org
  </Card>
  <Card title="Python Ecosystem" icon="python">
    **pip** - Protection for PyPI packages and dependencies
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Registry Scope Limitations

**PyPI Focus**: For Python packages, pmg currently only analyzes packages from the PyPI registry. Packages installed from:
- Git URLs (`pip install git+https://...`)
- Local file paths (`pip install ./local-package`)
- Private registries (`pip install -i private-index`)
- Alternative indexes (`--extra-index-url`)

Are **not analyzed** for malware detection and will install normally.

**npm Registry Focus**: Similarly, for Node.js packages, PMG focuses on npmjs.org registry packages.

## Technical Considerations

### Version Resolution Accuracy

PMG must make intelligent approximations about final package versions since it operates **before** package manager execution:

**Challenges:**
- Complex dependency resolution algorithms vary between package managers
- Version ranges can resolve differently based on existing dependencies
- Lock file states affect final resolution

**PMG's Approach:**
- Implements heuristic-based resolution that mirrors package manager behavior
- Prioritizes security over perfect version matching
- Continuously improves resolution accuracy based on real-world usage

<Warning>
  PMG uses approximate dependency resolution since it must evaluate packages **before** installation. While highly accurate, there may be edge cases where version resolution differs from the package manager's final resolution.
</Warning>

### Performance Characteristics

PMG introduces minimal latency through:

1. **Network Requests**: API calls to SafeDep Cloud for threat intelligence
2. **Dependency Computation**: Local dependency tree analysis
3. **Threat Evaluation**: Package risk assessment

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Intelligent caching of threat intelligence data
- Parallel dependency analysis where possible
- Minimal network overhead through efficient API design

### Operating Modes

PMG supports different operational modes for various scenarios:

```bash
# Silent mode - minimal output
pmg --silent npm install express

# Verbose mode - detailed analysis information  
pmg --verbose npm install express

# Dry run - analyze without installing
pmg --dry-run npm install express

# Debug mode - comprehensive logging
pmg --debug --log /tmp/pmg.log npm install express
```

## Integration Patterns

### Development Environment Integration
```bash
# One-time automated setup
pmg setup install

# Manual per-command usage
pmg npm install lodash
```

## Security Model

PMG operates on a **default-deny** security model for known threats:

- **Known malicious packages**: Blocked immediately with detailed warnings
- **Suspicious packages**: Prompt for user confirmation with a detailed report link for review
- **Verified clean packages**: Allowed without interference

This approach prioritizes **security over convenience** while maintaining usability for legitimate development workflows.
