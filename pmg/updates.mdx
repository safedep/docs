    # Trusted Packages
    
    `pmg` allows you to trust a package. Trusted packages are not scanned and always allowed to be installed.
    
    ## Configuration
    
    Trusted packages are configured in the `config.yml` file. See [config template](../config/config.template.yml) for the configuration schema.
    If you don't have a `config.yml` file, you can create one by running `pmg setup install`.
    
    ### Example
    
    ```yaml
    trusted_packages:
    - purl: pkg:npm/@safedep/pmg
      reason: "All versions of PMG are trusted"
    - purl: pkg:npm/express@4.18.0
      reason: "Version 4.18.0 of Express is a trusted package"
    ```  
    
  # Proxy Mode
  
  PMG supports an experimental proxy-based interception as an alternative to the current optimistic dependency resolution. When enabled via `--experimental-proxy-mode` flag:
  
  - PMG starts a micro-proxy server on a random localhost port
  - Runs `npm` and other supported package managers configured to use the proxy
  - Intercepts package registry requests and analyzes packages as they are downloaded
  - Blocks malicious packages and allows trusted packages to be installed
  
  ## Usage
  
  ```bash
  pmg --experimental-proxy-mode npm install lodash
  ```
  
  ## Configuration
  
  To permanently enable proxy mode, add the following to your `config.yml` file:
  
  ```yaml
  experimental_proxy_mode: true
  ```
