**Package Manager Guard (PMG)** protects developers from getting compromised by malicious packages by wrapping your favorite package manager and blocking malicious packages at install time.

<Info>
  PMG requires **no configuration** - just install and use it as you normally would with your package managers.
</Info>

## What is PMG?

PMG is a security wrapper for package managers that:

-  **Blocks malicious packages** at install time using SafeDep Cloud
-  **Performs deep dependency analysis** and transitive dependency resolution
-  **Works seamlessly** with existing package managers
-  **Requires zero configuration** - just install and use
-  **Protects in real-time** without slowing down your workflow

## Installation

### Using Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install safedep/tap/pmg
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/safedep/pmg@latest
```

### Download Binary

Download the latest release from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/safedep/pmg/releases) and add it to your PATH.

## Quick Setup

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with pmg's automated setup:

```bash
# Install shell aliases automatically
pmg setup install
```

This command will:
- Create a `~/.pmg.rc` file containing package manager aliases
- Add a source line to your shell configuration files
- Support bash, zsh, and fish shells

<Info>
  After running `pmg setup install`, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` (or your shell's config file) to activate the aliases.
</Info>

### Manual Usage (Alternative)

You can also run pmg manually without aliases:

```bash
pmg npm install <package-name>
pmg pnpm add <package-name>
pmg pip install <package-name>
```

If pmg detects a malicious package, it will block the installation and show you a warning.

## Supported Package Managers

PMG currently supports the following package managers:

| Package Manager | Status | Command Example |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| **npm** |  Active | `npm install <package>` |
| **pnpm** |  Active | `pnpm add <package>` |
| **pip** |  Active | `pip install <package>` |
| **yarn** |  Planned | Coming soon |
| **poetry** |  Planned | Coming soon |
| **uv** | Planned | Coming soon |

## Troubleshooting

### If pmg isn't working after setup:
1. Restart your terminal
2. Check that aliases were created: `which npm` should point to pmg
3. Verify pmg installation: `pmg version`

### If packages are incorrectly blocked:
1. Run with `--verbose` to see detection details
2. Check the [SafeDep community](https://discord.gg/kAGEj25dCn) for known issues
3. Report false positives on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/safedep/pmg/issues)

## Next Steps

- See the [pmg repository](https://github.com/safedep/pmg) for complete documentation and examples
- Learn [why PMG is needed](/pmg/concepts/why-pmg) for modern development
- Understand [how PMG works](/pmg/concepts/about) in detail
- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/kAGEj25dCn) for support
- Check out other SafeDep tools like [vet](/introduction) and [SafeDep Cloud](/cloud/overview)

<Tip>
  Run `pmg --help` to see all available commands and options. PMG is designed to be transparent - you should barely notice it's there until it protects you from a malicious package!
