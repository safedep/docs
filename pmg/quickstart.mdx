# SafeDep PMG Quickstart

**Package Manager Guard (PMG)** protects developers from getting compromised by malicious packages by wrapping your favorite package manager and blocking malicious packages at install time.

<Info>
  PMG requires **no configuration** - just install and use it as you normally would with your package managers.
</Info>

## What is PMG?

PMG is a security wrapper for package managers that:

- 🚫 **Blocks malicious packages** at install time using SafeDep Cloud
- 🌲 **Performs deep dependency analysis** and transitive dependency resolution
- ⚡ **Works seamlessly** with existing package managers
- 🔧 **Requires zero configuration** - just install and use
- 🛡️ **Protects in real-time** without slowing down your workflow

## Installation

### Using Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install safedep/tap/pmg
```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/safedep/pmg@latest
```

### Download Binary

Download the latest release from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/safedep/pmg/releases) and add it to your PATH.

## Quick Setup

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with pmg's automated setup:

```bash
# Install shell aliases automatically
pmg setup install
```

This command will:
- Create a `~/.pmg.rc` file containing package manager aliases
- Add a source line to your shell configuration files
- Support bash, zsh, and fish shells

<Info>
  After running `pmg setup install`, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` (or your shell's config file) to activate the aliases.
</Info>

### Manual Usage (Alternative)

You can also run pmg manually without aliases:

```bash
pmg npm install <package-name>
pmg pnpm add <package-name>
pmg pip install <package-name>
```

If pmg detects a malicious package, it will block the installation and show you a warning.

## Supported Package Managers

PMG currently supports the following package managers:

| Package Manager | Status | Command Example |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| **npm** | ✅ Active | `npm install <package>` |
| **pnpm** | ✅ Active | `pnpm add <package>` |
| **pip** | ✅ Active | `pip install <package>` |
| **yarn** | 🚧 Planned | Coming soon |
| **poetry** | 🚧 Planned | Coming soon |
| **uv** | 🚧 Planned | Coming soon |

## Command Options

### Silent Mode
Run pmg quietly without verbose output:
```bash
pmg --silent npm install <package-name>
```

### Dry Run
Check packages without actually installing them:
```bash
pmg --dry-run npm install <package-name>
```

### Verbose Mode
Get detailed information about what pmg is doing:
```bash
pmg --verbose npm install <package-name>
```

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
pmg --debug npm install <package-name>

# Save debug logs to a file
pmg --debug --log /tmp/debug.json npm install <package-name>
```

## Removing PMG

To remove pmg aliases and restore original package manager behavior:

```bash
pmg setup remove
```

This will:
- Remove the source line from your shell configuration files
- Delete the `~/.pmg.rc` file

## How PMG Works

PMG acts as an intelligent proxy between you and your package manager:

1. **Intercepts** package installation commands
2. **Analyzes** the package and its dependencies for malicious content
3. **Blocks** installation if threats are detected
4. **Allows** safe packages to install normally

## Troubleshooting

### If pmg isn't working after setup:
1. Restart your terminal
2. Check that aliases were created: `which npm` should show pmg
3. Verify pmg installation: `pmg version`

### If packages are incorrectly blocked:
1. Run with `--verbose` to see detection details
2. Check the [SafeDep community](https://discord.gg/kAGEj25dCn) for known issues
3. Report false positives on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/safedep/pmg/issues)

## Next Steps

- Learn [why PMG is needed](/pmg/concepts/why-pmg) for modern development
- Understand [how PMG works](/pmg/concepts/about) in detail
- Explore the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/safedep/pmg)
- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/kAGEj25dCn) for support
- Check out other SafeDep tools like [vet](/introduction) and [SafeDep Cloud](/cloud/overview)

<Tip>
  Run `pmg --help` to see all available commands and options. PMG is designed to be transparent - you should barely notice it's there until it protects you from a malicious package!
