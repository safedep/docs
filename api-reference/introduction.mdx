## Welcome

SafeDep supports a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API with
a [ConnectRPC](https://connectrpc.com/) facade allowing clients to use both
gRPC over HTTP/2 and JSON over HTTP/1.1 based clients.

The APIs are authenticated using [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) and API key
based authentication. The general rule for authentication is:

* Control plane APIs (e.g. creating policy) require OAuth 2.0 authentication
* Data plane APIs (e.g. getting policy data) can be accessed using API keys

Control Plane APIs are meant for use by management tools while the Data Plane
APIs are meant for use by security tools using or integrating with SafeDep.
