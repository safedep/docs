## Why SafeDep?


SafeDep [continuously scans open source packages for malicious code](https://safedep.io/dynamic-analysis-oss-package-at-scale/)
using a combination of static and dynamic analysis. Suspicious packages are verified by security experts to confirm malicious behavior.

Tools like [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet) and [PMG](https://github.com/safedep/pmg) leverage SafeDep's
malicious package detection capabilities to protect applications against open source software supply chain risks.

## Why Open Source Security Matters

<Info>
**Did you know?** It has been estimated that Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) constitutes **70-90%** of any given piece of modern software solutions.
</Info>

With this level of dependency on open source, security teams need automated tools to safely consume OSS components without slowing down development velocity.
