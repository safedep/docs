## Why Open Source Security Matters

<Info>
**Did you know?** It has been estimated that Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) constitutes **70-90%** of any given piece of modern software solutions.
</Info>

With this level of dependency on open source, security teams need automated tools to safely consume OSS components without slowing down development velocity.

## Open Source First

SafeDep is built on the belief that security tools should be **free, transparent, and accessible to everyone**.
Our core mission is to provide the security community with powerful open source tools that protect applications
from supply chain threats.

**Our Open Source Tools:**
- **[vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet)** - Supply chain security analysis for CI/CD pipelines
- **[pmg](https://github.com/safedep/pmg)** - Protect developers from malicious open source packages
- **[xBom](https://github.com/safedep/xbom)** - SBOM enriched with AI, Crypto and other metadata using static code analysis

These tools are completely free and built in public with community involvement. They operate independently and can be
used without any commercial relationship with SafeDep.

## How SafeDep Works

SafeDep [continuously scans open source packages for malicious code](https://safedep.io/dynamic-analysis-oss-package-at-scale/)
using a combination of static and dynamic analysis. Suspicious packages are verified by security experts to confirm malicious behavior.

Both our open source tools and SafeDep Cloud leverage this malicious package detection capability to provide
comprehensive protection against open source software supply chain risks.

<Info>
The diagram below shows how SafeDep works to protect your open source software supply chain
against malicious packages.
