description: "Speed up filtering and reporting by working with enriched JSON data dumps"
---

Scanning package manifests is resource-intensive as it involves enriching package metadata by querying the Insights API. However, filtering and reporting may be done multiple times on the same manifest. To speed up this process, you can dump enriched data as JSON and load it for subsequent filtering and reporting operations.

## Query Workflow

The BYOQ workflow consists of two main phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Collection">
    Scan and enrich package data, then dump to JSON files for reuse
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Analysis & Reporting">
    Load enriched data for fast filtering, querying, and report generation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Phase 1: Dump Enriched JSON Manifests

Collect and enrich package data, then save to a directory for reuse:

```bash
# Single manifest file
vet scan --lockfile /path/to/package-lock.json --json-dump-dir /tmp/dump

# Entire repository
vet scan -D /path/to/repository --json-dump-dir /tmp/dump-many
```

<Info>
The JSON dump contains all enriched metadata including vulnerabilities, scorecard data, licenses, and project information.
</Info>

### Phase 2: Load and Query Enriched Metadata

Use the dumped data for fast filtering and reporting:

```bash
# Generate summary report
vet query --from /tmp/dump --report-summary

# Apply custom filters
vet query --from /tmp/dump --filter 'scorecard.scores.Maintained == 0'
```

## Security Guardrails with Filters

Implement security guardrails in CI/CD pipelines using the `--filter-fail` argument, which causes the command to fail if any package matches the given filter.

### Example: Fail Build on Unmaintained Packages

```bash
vet query --from /path/to/json-dump \
    --filter 'scorecard.scores.Maintained == 0' \
    --filter-fail
```

When packages match the filter criteria, the command exits with a non-zero status:

```bash
echo $?
# Output: 255
```

## Advanced Query Examples

### Multi-Criteria Security Checks

```bash
# Fail on critical vulnerabilities OR unmaintained packages
vet query --from /tmp/dump \
    --filter 'vulns.critical.size() > 0 || scorecard.scores.Maintained == 0' \
    --filter-fail
```

### License Compliance Checks

```bash
# Find packages with non-approved licenses
vet query --from /tmp/dump \
    --filter '!licenses.exists(p, p in ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause"])' \
    --report-json compliance-violations.json
```

### Risk Assessment Queries

```bash
# Find high-risk packages (multiple criteria)
vet query --from /tmp/dump \
    --filter 'vulns.high.size() > 0 && scorecard.scores.Security < 5 && projects.exists(p, p.stars < 100)'
```
