# Contributing to SafeDep Documentation

Welcome to the SafeDep Documentation repository! We're excited to have you contribute to making our documentation better for the security engineering community.

## Documentation Framework

This repository follows the **[DiÃ¡taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr)** for systematic documentation architecture. DiÃ¡taxis organizes documentation into four distinct types based on user needs and context:

- **ðŸ“– Tutorials** - Learning-oriented, hands-on lessons
- **ðŸ”§ How-to Guides** - Problem-oriented, practical solutions  
- **ðŸ“š Reference** - Information-oriented, technical specifications
- **ðŸ’¡ Explanation** - Understanding-oriented, theoretical knowledge

Before contributing, we strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the [DiÃ¡taxis principles](https://diataxis.fr) to understand how different types of content should be structured and written.

## Repository Structure & DiÃ¡taxis Mapping

## Content Standards

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Follow DiÃ¡taxis Principles**
   - Identify which quadrant your content belongs to
   - Write in the appropriate style for that content type
   - Don't mix different content types in the same document

2. **Use Clear, Accessible Language**
   - Write for international audiences
   - Define technical terms when first introduced
   - Use active voice when possible
   - Keep sentences concise and scannable

3. **Structure for Scannability**
   - Use descriptive headings (H2, H3)
   - Include bullet points and numbered lists
   - Add code examples and visual elements
   - Use callout components for important information

### Technical Standards

1. **Mintlify Components**
   - Use `<CardGroup>` and `<Card>` for related links
   - Use `<Steps>` for sequential processes
   - Use `<Tabs>` for alternative approaches
   - Use `<AccordionGroup>` for optional details
   - Use `<Info>`, `<Warning>`, `<Tip>`, `<Note>` callouts appropriately

2. **Code Examples**
   - Always test code examples before including them
   - Use syntax highlighting with appropriate language tags
   - Include comments explaining complex parts
   - Provide complete, runnable examples when possible

3. **Cross-References**
   - Link to related content within the documentation
   - Use descriptive link text (avoid "click here")
   - Link to authoritative external sources
   - Keep external links current and relevant

### File Organization

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use kebab-case for file names (`my-guide.mdx`)
   - Choose descriptive, specific names
   - Avoid generic names like `guide.mdx` or `tutorial.mdx`

2. **Frontmatter Requirements**
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Descriptive Page Title
   description: "Clear, searchable description under 160 characters"
   ---
   ```

3. **Content Structure**
   - Start with frontmatter
   - Begin content immediately (no H1 header)
   - Use H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
   - End with related links using `<CardGroup>`

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Planning Your Contribution

Before writing, consider:
- **What type of content** are you creating? (Tutorial, How-to, Reference, Explanation)
- **Who is your audience?** (Beginners, experienced users, developers, security teams)
- **What problem does this solve?** (Specific user need or gap in documentation)
- **Where should this live?** (Which directory and section)

### 2. Writing Process

1. **Create an outline** following DiÃ¡taxis principles for your content type
2. **Draft the content** using our content standards
3. **Test all examples** to ensure they work correctly
4. **Review for clarity** and accessibility
5. **Check cross-references** and external links

### 3. Quality Checklist

Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] Content follows appropriate DiÃ¡taxis quadrant principles
- [ ] All code examples are tested and working
- [ ] Links are functional and point to current resources
- [ ] Images are optimized and have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Content is accessible to international audiences
- [ ] Frontmatter includes title and description
- [ ] No redundant H1 headers (Mintlify handles titles)
- [ ] Related content is properly cross-referenced

### 4. Submission Guidelines

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Follow conventional commit messages**:
   ```
   type(scope): description
   
   docs(guides): add terraform security audit guide
   fix(concepts): clarify vet architecture explanation

   ```

3. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description explaining the motivation
   - Screenshots for visual changes
   - Testing notes for code examples

4. **Respond to feedback** constructively and promptly

## Review Process

1. **DiÃ¡taxis Compliance** - Does content fit the intended quadrant?
2. **Technical Accuracy** - Are examples and instructions correct?
3. **User Experience** - Is content helpful for the intended audience?
4. **Writing Quality** - Is it clear, concise, and well-structured?
5. **Integration** - Does it fit well with existing documentation?

### Review Timeline
