- <Icon icon="robot" size={14} /> ML models
- <Icon icon="code" size={14} /> 3rd party SaaS APIs
- <Icon icon="lock" size={14} /> Cryptographic algorithms

Traditional BOM tools often focus solely on listed dependencies in manifest files (like `requirements.txt` or `pom.xml`). xBom addresses the need for a deeper insight into the actual components and services your code interacts with, providing a more accurate inventory for compliance, security, and operational awareness.
