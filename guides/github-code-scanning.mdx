# GitHub Code Scanning Integration

GitHub supports [uploading SARIF](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning) reports to enable repository and organization-wide visibility of security events across different tools. `vet` supports exporting policy violation reports as SARIF which can be uploaded to GitHub.

## Quick Setup with GitHub Action

`vet` has a dedicated GitHub Action for easy integration. This is the recommended approach for most teams.

### Basic Configuration

Create `.github/workflows/vet.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: OSS Security Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  vet-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run vet
        id: vet
        uses: safedep/vet-action@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Upload SARIF
        if: steps.vet.outputs.report != ''
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ steps.vet.outputs.report }}
          category: vet
```

<Info>
SARIF reports work when you enable GitHub Code Scanning in your repository. [Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning)
</Info>

### Advanced Configuration

For more control over the scanning process:

```yaml
      - name: Run vet with custom policy
        id: vet
        uses: safedep/vet-action@v1
        with:
          policy: '.github/vet-policy.yml'
          fail-on-violation: true
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Manual SARIF Generation

You can also generate SARIF reports manually using the `vet` CLI:

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/project --report-sarif /path/to/report.sarif
```

<Warning>
`vet` will only include policy violations in the SARIF report. A policy must be provided using `--filter` or `--filter-suite` flag during scan.
</Warning>

## Viewing Results

Once the SARIF report is uploaded to GitHub, policy violations will be available in the GitHub Security tab. This provides a centralized view of policy violations across different repositories.

## Pull Request Integration

The GitHub Action automatically adds comments to pull requests when security issues are found:

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Policy Configuration">
    Store your vet policies in version control (e.g., `.github/vet-policy.yml`) to ensure consistent security standards across your organization.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Branch Protection">
    Configure branch protection rules to require the vet check to pass before merging pull requests.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Organization-wide Deployment">
    Use GitHub organization templates to deploy vet across all repositories automatically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SARIF Upload Fails">
    Ensure the `security-events: write` permission is set in your workflow file and that Code Scanning is enabled for your repository.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No Violations Reported">
    Check that your policy configuration is correct and that violations actually exist. Use `--report-json` locally to debug.
