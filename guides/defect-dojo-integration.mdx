`vet` supports integration with [DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) to track and manage vulnerabilities. You can export vulnerabilities, policy violations, and other findings to DefectDojo. Each scan is reported as a new engagement in DefectDojo.

## Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Docker & Docker Compose" icon="docker">
    Required for running DefectDojo locally
  </Card>
  <Card title="DefectDojo Instance" icon="server">
    Either local or cloud-hosted DefectDojo installation
  </Card>
  <Card title="vet CLI" icon="terminal">
    Install vet following the quickstart guide
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Access" icon="key">
    DefectDojo API key for authentication
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

If you don't have vet installed yet, follow the [quickstart guide](/quickstart) to get started.

## Quick Setup with Docker

For this example, we'll set up a DefectDojo instance using Docker Compose and scan the [demo-client-python](https://github.com/safedep/demo-client-python) repository.

### Setup DefectDojo

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone DefectDojo">
    Download the DefectDojo repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo.git --depth 1
    cd django-DefectDojo
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Services">
    Launch DefectDojo with Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    <Info>
    This will take a while as it builds images and downloads dependencies.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Admin Password">
    Retrieve the admin password from the logs:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs initializer | grep "Admin password:"
    ```
    <Note>
    The initializer container runs migrations and creates initial data, which may take several minutes.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access DefectDojo">
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and login with:
    - **Username**: `admin`
    - **Password**: (from previous step)
    
    <img src="/images/defect-dojo-integration/dd-1-login.png" alt="DefectDojo Login" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure Your Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Product">
    Create a new product called `demo-client-python` and note the product ID:
    
    <img src="/images/defect-dojo-integration/dd-2-add-product.png" alt="DefectDojo Add Product" />
    
    <img src="/images/defect-dojo-integration/dd-3-observe-product-id.png" alt="DefectDojo Product ID" />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/api/key-v2` to generate an API key for vet integration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Environment Variable">
    Configure the API key for vet usage:
    ```bash
    export DEFECT_DOJO_APIV2_KEY=<your-api-key>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Scanning with vet

Now you can scan a project and send results to DefectDojo:

```bash
vet scan --github https://github.com/safedep/demo-client-python \
  --filter-suite /path/to/your/policy-suite.yml \
  --report-defect-dojo \
  --defect-dojo-host-url http://localhost:8080/ \
  --defect-dojo-product-id <your-product-id>
```

  <Card title="Engagement Creation" icon="plus">
    vet creates a new engagement in DefectDojo for each scan
  </Card>
  <Card title="Policy Violations" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    Policy violations are reported as findings in DefectDojo
  </Card>
  <Card title="Centralized Tracking" icon="chart-line">
    All security findings are tracked in DefectDojo's dashboard
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workflow Integration" icon="workflow">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Currently, vet reports only policy violations to DefectDojo. Support for reporting vulnerabilities and malicious package information is planned in [GitHub issue #430](https://github.com/safedep/vet/issues/430).
</Warning>

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Policy Suites

Create comprehensive policy suites for DefectDojo integration:

```yaml
# defectdojo-policy.yml
name: DefectDojo Security Policy
description: Comprehensive policy for DefectDojo integration
filters:
  - name: critical-vulnerabilities
    value: |
      vulns.critical.size() > 0
      
  - name: high-risk-packages
    value: |
      vulns.high.size() > 3
      
  - name: license-violations
    value: |
      !licenses.exists(p, p in ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause"])
      
  - name: unmaintained-packages
    value: |
      scorecard.scores.Maintained < 5
```

### CI/CD Integration

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GitHub Actions">
    ```yaml
    name: Security Scan to DefectDojo
    on: [push, pull_request]
    
    jobs:
      security-scan:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          
          - name: Run vet security scan
            run: |
              vet scan -D . \
                --filter-suite .github/security-policy.yml \
                --report-defect-dojo \
                --defect-dojo-host-url ${{ secrets.DEFECT_DOJO_URL }} \
                --defect-dojo-product-id ${{ secrets.DEFECT_DOJO_PRODUCT_ID }}
            env:
              DEFECT_DOJO_APIV2_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEFECT_DOJO_API_KEY }}
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="GitLab CI">
    ```yaml
    security-scan:
      image: ghcr.io/safedep/vet:latest
      script:
        - vet scan -D . 
            --filter-suite security-policy.yml
            --report-defect-dojo
            --defect-dojo-host-url $DEFECT_DOJO_URL
            --defect-dojo-product-id $DEFECT_DOJO_PRODUCT_ID
      variables:
        DEFECT_DOJO_APIV2_KEY: $DEFECT_DOJO_API_KEY
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Multiple Projects

For organizations with multiple projects, create separate products in DefectDojo:

```bash
# Project A
vet scan -D ./project-a \
  --report-defect-dojo \
  --defect-dojo-product-id 1

# Project B  
vet scan -D ./project-b \
  --report-defect-dojo \
  --defect-dojo-product-id 2
```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Key Issues">
    If authentication fails:
    - Verify the API key is correctly set in the environment
    - Check that the API key has sufficient permissions
    - Ensure the DefectDojo URL is accessible from your environment
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Product ID Errors">
    If the product ID is invalid:
    - Verify the product exists in DefectDojo
    - Check that you have access to the specified product
    - Ensure the product ID is numeric, not the product name
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No Findings Reported">
    If no findings appear in DefectDojo:
    - Confirm that policy violations exist in your scan
    - Check the vet scan output for errors
    - Verify the DefectDojo integration is properly configured
