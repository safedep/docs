`vet` supports native GitLab Dependency Scanning. You can use `vet` to protect your project from malicious and vulnerable dependencies on every push and merge request to GitLab.

## Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="GitLab Account" icon="gitlab">
    Active GitLab account with access to your project
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ultimate Plan" icon="crown">
    GitLab Group with Ultimate Plan for security scanning features
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Security scanning features are only available to GitLab Ultimate plans. Free users can still use the **vet CI component** to find vulnerabilities and check policy violations. See the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfSRc4p-z4) for free usage.
</Info>

## Quick Setup

### 1. Enable CI on Your Project

Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of your project:

```bash
touch .gitlab-ci.yml
```

### 2. Add vet as a CI Component

Add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.5.0
```

**That's it! ðŸš€** Commit and push changes to trigger your first scan.

## Viewing Results

Once configured, you'll see the `vet` job in your pipeline with a security tab:

View vulnerabilities and malware findings in the security tab:

Access detailed reports at **Project > Secure > Vulnerability Report**:

## Configuration Options

### Cloud Sync Integration

Enable [SafeDep Cloud](/cloud/quickstart) synchronization:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.5.0
    inputs:
      cloud: true
      cloud-key: $CLOUD_KEY
      cloud-tenant: $CLOUD_TENANT
```

<Warning>
Store `CLOUD_KEY` and `CLOUD_TENANT` as GitLab CI/CD variables for security.
</Warning>

### Policy Configuration

Use custom policies for advanced filtering:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.5.0
    inputs:
      policy: '.gitlab/vet/policy.yml'
```

The CI job will fail if any policy violations are found. Check the logs to identify which policies were violated.

### Version Control

Specify which version of `vet` to use:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.5.0
    inputs:
      version: v1.9.0
```

### Trusted Registries

Configure trusted registry URLs for package verification:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.5.0
    inputs:
      trusted-registries:
        - https://registry.npmjs.org
        - https://pypi.org
```

### Artifact Access

Control who can access scan artifacts:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.5.0
    inputs:
      artifact-access: 'developer'  # Options: all, developer, none
```

<Warning>
Only use `all` if you're comfortable exposing security scan results publicly.
</Warning>

## Advanced Examples

### Multi-Stage Pipeline

```yaml
stages:
  - security
  - build
  - deploy

include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.5.0
    inputs:
      stage: security
      policy: '.gitlab/security-policy.yml'
      cloud: true
      cloud-key: $SAFEDEP_CLOUD_KEY
      cloud-tenant: $SAFEDEP_CLOUD_TENANT

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building application..."
  needs: ["vet"]
```

### Conditional Scanning

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/safedep/ci-components/vet/scan@v1.5.0
    rules:
      - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
      - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security Tab Not Visible">
    Ensure your GitLab plan includes security scanning features. Ultimate plan is required for the security dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CI Component Not Found">
    Verify you're using the correct component path and version. Check the [GitLab Component Catalog](https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/safedep/ci-components/vet) for the latest version.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Policy Violations Failing Build">
    This is expected behavior when violations are found. Review the job logs to understand which policies were violated and either fix the issues or adjust your policy configuration.
