# Code Analysis

<Warning>
**EXPERIMENTAL**: This feature is experimental and may introduce breaking changes in future releases.
</Warning>

`vet` uses the [code](https://github.com/safedep/code/) analysis framework built on top of [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) parsers. The goal of this framework is to support multiple languages, source repositories (local and remote), and report the findings.

`vet` uses these findings to create a Code analysis database, which can be used for enriching and analyzing manifests during scanning.

## Build a Code Analysis Database

Analyze code and build a SQLite database for further analysis. This is a prerequisite to enable code analysis features in `vet scan`.

```bash
vet code scan --app /path/to/app \
    --db /tmp/code.db \
    --lang python
```

### What This Command Does

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Code Analysis" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Utilizes the code framework to analyze application code recursively in the specified directory
  </Card>
  <Card title="Language Support" icon="code">
    Supports multiple languages - omit `--lang` to analyze all supported languages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Database Creation" icon="database">
    Creates a SQLite database with reported findings for later use
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tree-sitter Powered" icon="tree">
    Uses tree-sitter parsers for accurate code parsing and analysis
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Supported Languages

The code analysis framework supports multiple programming languages through tree-sitter parsers:

- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- Go
- And more...

<Tip>
Omit the `--lang` parameter to enable analysis of all supported languages automatically.
</Tip>

## Scan with Dependency Usage Analysis

To enable code analysis features in `vet scan`, provide the Code analysis database path using the `--code` flag.

Dependency usage analysis is a fundamental feature that's enabled by default when using a code database.

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/code --code /tmp/code.db
```

### Enhanced Scanning Features

When using code analysis, `vet scan` provides:

1. **Manifest Analysis**: Analyzes package manifests in the specified directory
2. **Usage Enrichment**: Uses the Code Analysis database to enrich packages with dependency usage data
3. **Evidence-Based Results**: Shows scan summary with usage evidences and `used-in-code` tags proving actual library usage

## Practical Example

Here's a complete workflow for analyzing a Python project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze Code">
    Build the code analysis database for your Python project:
    ```bash
    vet code scan --app ./src \
        --db ./analysis/code.db \
        --lang python
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enhanced Scan">
    Run vet scan with code analysis integration:
    ```bash
    vet scan -D . \
        --code ./analysis/code.db \
        --report-json results.json
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Check the scan results for:
    - Dependencies actually used in code vs. declared
    - Unused dependencies that could be removed
    - Usage patterns and import analysis
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits of Code Analysis

### Accurate Risk Assessment

By identifying which dependencies are actually used in your code, you can:
- Prioritize security fixes for actively used packages
- Ignore vulnerabilities in unused dependencies
- Make informed decisions about dependency removal

### Dependency Optimization

Code analysis helps identify:
- **Unused Dependencies**: Packages declared but never imported
- **Over-declared Dependencies**: Libraries with minimal usage
- **Missing Dependencies**: Code imports without corresponding declarations

### Supply Chain Insights

Enhanced visibility into:
- How dependencies are used throughout your codebase
- Which functions/modules are imported from each package
- Dependency usage patterns and trends

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-language Projects

For projects with multiple languages, run analysis without the `--lang` flag:

```bash
vet code scan --app ./src --db ./analysis/polyglot.db
```

### Custom Database Locations

Organize analysis databases by project or environment:

```bash
# Development environment
vet code scan --app ./src --db ./analysis/dev-code.db

# Production analysis
vet code scan --app ./dist --db ./analysis/prod-code.db
```

### Integration with CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Build Code Analysis DB
  run: vet code scan --app ./src --db ./code-analysis.db

- name: Enhanced Security Scan
  run: vet scan -D . --code ./code-analysis.db --report-sarif security.sarif
```

## Limitations and Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Experimental Status">
    This feature is experimental and may have breaking changes. Test thoroughly before using in production environments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance Impact">
    Code analysis adds processing time to scans. Consider the trade-off between accuracy and speed for your use case.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Storage Requirements">
    Code analysis databases can become large for extensive codebases. Monitor disk usage and clean up old databases regularly.
