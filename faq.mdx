# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and troubleshooting tips for using vet effectively.

## General Usage

### How do I disable the banner?

Set the environment variable to disable the vet banner:

```bash
export VET_DISABLE_BANNER=1
```

### Something is wrong! How do I debug this?

Run vet with debug logging enabled to diagnose issues:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Log to stdout">
    ```bash
    vet scan -D /path/to/repo --silent --log-level debug
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Log to file">
    ```bash
    vet scan -D /path/to/repo --log-file /tmp/vet.log --log-level debug
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Verbose output">
    ```bash
    vet scan -D /path/to/repo --verbose
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Installation and Setup

### Which version of vet should I use?

Always use the latest stable version available:

```bash
# Check current version
vet version

# Update via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew upgrade safedep/tap/vet

# Or download latest from GitHub releases
# https://github.com/safedep/vet/releases
```

### Does vet work offline?

vet requires internet connectivity to:
- Download vulnerability data from OSV database
- Fetch OpenSSF Scorecard information
- Access package registry metadata
- Communicate with SafeDep Cloud (if using cloud features)

For offline environments, consider using the JSON dump workflow to cache data locally.

### What package managers does vet support?

vet supports a wide range of package managers:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="JavaScript/Node.js">
    - package-lock.json (npm)
    - yarn.lock (Yarn)
    - pnpm-lock.yaml (pnpm)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Python">
    - requirements.txt
    - Pipfile.lock (Pipenv)
    - poetry.lock (Poetry)
    - pyproject.toml
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Java/JVM">

    - build.gradle (Gradle)
    - gradle.lockfile
  </Accordion>

    - Gemfile.lock (Ruby)
    - Cargo.lock (Rust)
    - composer.lock (PHP)
    - And many more...
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Scanning and Analysis

### Why is my scan taking so long?

Several factors can affect scan performance:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Large dependency trees">
    Use path exclusions to skip irrelevant directories:
    ```bash
    vet scan -D . --exclude 'node_modules/*' --exclude 'test/*'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Network latency">
    The scan fetches metadata from external sources. Slow internet can impact performance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Malware analysis">
    If using `--malware`, adjust the timeout:
    ```bash
    vet scan -D . --malware --malware-analysis-timeout 5m
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="First-time caching">
    Initial scans may be slower as vet builds local caches.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### No vulnerabilities found - is this correct?

If vet reports no vulnerabilities:

1. **Check the package versions** - Ensure you're scanning current dependency versions
2. **Verify manifest files** - Confirm vet is finding and parsing your package manifests
3. **Check exclusions** - Make sure you haven't excluded relevant directories
4. **Review scan output** - Look for any warnings or errors during scanning

### How do I scan only specific files?

Use the `-M` flag to specify individual manifest files:

```bash
# Single file
vet scan -M package-lock.json

# Multiple files
vet scan -M package-lock.json -M requirements.txt
```

## Policy and Filtering

### How do I create effective policies?

Follow these best practices for policy creation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple">
    Begin with basic vulnerability checks:
    ```bash
    --filter 'vulns.critical.size() > 0'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Thoroughly">
    Test policies against known good and bad packages before deploying.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Gradual Rollout">
    Start with warning-only mode before enforcing blocking policies.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document Decisions">
    Include comments in policy files explaining the rationale for each rule.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Why is my filter not working?

Common filter issues and solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Syntax Errors">
    Verify CEL expression syntax:
    ```bash
    # Correct
    vulns.critical.size() > 0
    
    # Incorrect
    vulns.critical.length() > 0  # Use size(), not length()
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Structure">
    Check the filter input specification to understand available fields.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Boolean Logic">
    Ensure your expression evaluates to true/false:
    ```bash
    # Returns boolean
    licenses.exists(p, p == "MIT")
    
    # Returns array (won't work as filter)
    licenses
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance and Optimization

### How can I speed up my scans?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Path Exclusions">
    Skip irrelevant directories:
    ```bash
    vet scan -D . \
      --exclude 'test/*' \
      --exclude 'docs/*' \
      --exclude 'examples/*'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Scan Specific Manifests">
    Target only relevant package files:
    ```bash
    vet scan -M package-lock.json -M requirements.txt
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use JSON Dump Workflow">
    Cache enriched data for repeated analysis:
    ```bash
    vet scan -D . --json-dump-dir /tmp/cache
    vet query --from /tmp/cache --filter 'your-filter'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Parallel Processing">
    For multiple projects, run scans in parallel or use CI/CD matrix builds.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## CI/CD Integration

### My GitHub Action is failing - what should I check?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Action Version">
    Ensure you're using the latest version of vet-action:
    ```yaml
    uses: safedep/vet-action@v1  # Use latest stable
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permissions">
    Check GitHub token permissions:
    ```yaml
    permissions:
      contents: read
      security-events: write  # For SARIF upload
      pull-requests: write    # For PR comments
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Secrets Configuration">
    Verify required secrets are set if using SafeDep Cloud:
    - `SAFEDEP_CLOUD_API_KEY`
    - `SAFEDEP_CLOUD_TENANT_DOMAIN`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How do I handle false positives in CI?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Exceptions">
    Create an exceptions file for known false positives:
    ```yaml
    - name: Run vet with exceptions
      uses: safedep/vet-action@v1
      with:
        exception-file: '.github/vet-exceptions.yml'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Adjust Policies">
    Refine your filter expressions to reduce noise:
    ```bash
    # Be more specific about severity
    --filter 'vulns.critical.size() > 0'
    # Instead of
    --filter 'vulns.all.size() > 0'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Warning Mode">
    Don't fail builds while tuning policies:
    ```yaml
    with:
      fail-on-violation: false
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data and Privacy

### What data does vet collect?

vet collects:
- **Package metadata** from public registries
- **Vulnerability data** from public databases (OSV, NVD)
- **OpenSSF Scorecard** metrics from public repositories
- **No source code** is ever analyzed or transmitted

### Does vet send my code anywhere?

No. vet only analyzes package manifest files (like package-lock.json) and does not access or transmit your source code. All analysis is based on publicly available package metadata.

### Can I use vet in air-gapped environments?

vet requires internet access for vulnerability data and package metadata. For air-gapped environments:

1. **Pre-cache data** using the JSON dump workflow
2. **Use proxy servers** to control external access
3. **Consider enterprise solutions** for offline vulnerability databases

## Troubleshooting
