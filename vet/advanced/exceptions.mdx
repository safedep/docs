title: Exceptions Management
description: "Manage false positives and acceptable risks with time-bound exceptions"
---

Any security scanning tool may produce false positives, issues that are acceptable for a period of time, or issues that need to be temporarily ignored. `vet` supports adding packages to an exceptions list, excluding them from scan results and reports.

<Warning>
Package exceptions must be handled with care. Any package added to the exceptions list will not be scanned and reported, including any future issues that may arise. To mitigate this risk, all exceptions must have an expiration date and cannot be permanent.
</Warning>

## Generating Exceptions List

### Manual Creation

Create an `exceptions.yml` file with the following structure:

```yaml
description: Exceptions File for vet
exceptions:
  - ecosystem: npm
    expires: "2025-05-10T00:00:00Z"
    id: 01JKMC07KAGJYEDZX1XPAC3SKP
    name: '@babel/plugin-transform-function-name'
    version: 7.18.9
    reason: "False positive - CVE doesn't apply to our usage"

  - ecosystem: npm
    expires: "2025-05-10T00:00:00Z"
    id: 01JKMC07KASSGYH1PHQY09QNZ3
    name: '@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread'
    version: 7.12.1
    reason: "Legacy dependency being replaced in Q2 2025"
```

<Note>
- The `expires` field is mandatory and must be in RFC3339 format
- The `id` field must be unique and can be any unique string format
- Adding a `reason` field is recommended for documentation
</Note>

### Automated Generation with vet

Generate exceptions automatically based on filter criteria:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scan and Dump Data">
    Run a scan and dump raw data to a temporary directory:
    ```bash
    vet scan -D /path/to/repo --json-dump-dir /path/to/dump
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Conditional Exceptions">
    Create exceptions for packages without critical or high severity issues:
    ```bash
    vet query --from /path/to/dump \
        --exceptions-generate /path/to/exceptions.yml \
        --exceptions-filter '!vulns.critical.exists(p, true) && !vulns.high.exists(p, true)' \
        --exceptions-till '2025-05-01'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Refine">
    Review the generated exceptions file and remove unnecessary entries
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Generate Exceptions for All Packages

<Warning>
Adding all packages to exceptions is not recommended. Only do this for specific use cases like baseline establishment.
</Warning>

```bash
vet query --from /path/to/dump \
    --exceptions-generate /path/to/exceptions.yml \
    --exceptions-filter 'true' \
    --exceptions-till '2025-12-12'
```

<Info>
`--exceptions-till` is parsed as `YYYY-mm-dd` and generates a timestamp of `00:00:00` UTC for the specified date in RFC3339 format.
</Info>

## Using Exceptions

### With vet-action (GitHub Actions)

[vet-action](https://github.com/safedep/vet-action) supports custom exceptions configuration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Exceptions File">
    Create `.github/vet/exceptions.yml` in your repository with your exceptions configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Workflow">
    Update your GitHub Actions workflow to include the exceptions file:
    ```yaml
    - name: Vet Scan
      uses: safedep/vet-action@v1
      with:
        exception-file: .github/vet/exceptions.yml
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### With vet CLI

Pass an exceptions file as a global flag to `vet`:

```bash
vet --exceptions /path/to/exceptions.yml scan -D /path/to/repo
```

<Caution>
Do not pass the exceptions flag while generating exceptions lists in query workflows to avoid incorrect exception list generation.
</Caution>

## Exception Behavior

### Matching Rules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Package Matching">
    - All exceptions rules are applied only at the package level
    - Comparisons are case-insensitive except for version
    - Version field can use `*` to match any version
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scope and Application">
    - Exceptions are globally managed and shared across packages
    - Exempted packages are ignored by all analyzers and reporters
    - First match policy applies for exception matching
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Expiration Handling">
    - Expired exceptions are automatically ignored
    - No exceptions can be created without an expiry date
    - System validates expiry dates during processing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Exception Patterns

### Environment-Specific Exceptions

Create different exception files for different environments:

```yaml
# exceptions-dev.yml
description: Development environment exceptions
exceptions:
  - ecosystem: npm
    expires: "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z"
    id: dev-001
    name: 'webpack-dev-server'
    version: '*'
    reason: "Development dependency with known issues"

# exceptions-prod.yml
description: Production environment exceptions
exceptions:
  - ecosystem: npm
    expires: "2025-03-01T00:00:00Z"
    id: prod-001
    name: 'legacy-auth-lib'
    version: '1.2.3'
    reason: "Critical dependency being replaced in Q1"
```

### Conditional Exception Generation

Generate exceptions based on specific criteria:

```bash
# Only low and medium severity issues
vet query --from /path/to/dump \
    --exceptions-generate exceptions-low-medium.yml \
    --exceptions-filter 'vulns.critical.size() == 0 && vulns.high.size() == 0' \
    --exceptions-till '2025-06-01'

# Packages with good maintenance scores
vet query --from /path/to/dump \
    --exceptions-generate exceptions-maintained.yml \
    --exceptions-filter 'scorecard.scores.Maintained > 7' \
    --exceptions-till '2025-08-01'
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Security Scan with Exceptions
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run security scan
        uses: safedep/vet-action@v1
        with:
          exception-file: '.github/vet/exceptions.yml'

      - name: Check for expired exceptions
        run: |
          # Custom script to check for exceptions expiring soon
          python scripts/check-exception-expiry.py .github/vet/exceptions.yml
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Exception Hygiene">
    - Set reasonable expiration dates (3-6 months maximum)
    - Include detailed reasons for each exception
    - Review exceptions monthly for relevance
    - Remove exceptions when issues are resolved
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Documentation">
    - Maintain a change log for exceptions
    - Link exceptions to tickets or remediation plans
    - Include contact information for exception owners
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Governance">
    - Require approval for production exceptions
    - Implement automated expiry notifications
    - Regular security review of all active exceptions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

<Warning>
The following patterns will NOT be implemented to prevent security risks:

- **Manifest-level exceptions**: Would cause false negatives across entire manifests
- **Permanent exceptions**: All exceptions must have expiry dates
- **Blanket exceptions**: Avoid using `*` wildcards without specific justification
</Warning>
