For more information on scanning options, refer to [vet's README](https://github.com/safedep/vet).

## Policy as Code

`vet` supports [CEL](https://cel.dev/) based policy language for identifying risks. Scan and fail on critical or high risk vulnerabilities:

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/dir \
  --filter '(vulns.critical.size() > 0) || (vulns.high.size() > 0)' \
  --filter-fail
```

### Advanced Policy Configuration

Multiple CEL queries can be combined to create a comprehensive policy. [See example](https://github.com/safedep/vet/blob/main/samples/filter-suites/fs-generic.yml). Audit your application using your opinionated policy as code:

```bash
vet scan -D /path/to/dir \
  --filter-suite /path/to/policy.yml \
  --filter-fail
```

## Setup CI/CD Guardrails

`vet` supports a native [GitHub Action](https://github.com/safedep/vet-action) that can be used to easily setup policy-driven guardrails against risky OSS components.
